# Defect-Detection-OpenCV(uninteligent)


Surface Defect Detection script(unintelligent) to detect defects on the surface of a glove using python and OpenCV library
##### Just playing with OpenCV





### Tech

This script uses:

* [python3](https://www.python.org/) 
* [OpenCV-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.


### Installation

This script requires [python3](https://www.python.org/) v3+ to run.

Install the virtual environment(venv) and required libraries to run.

```sh
$ cd <directory>
$ pip install virtualenv
```

To activate venv...

```sh
$ cd venv/Scripts
$ activate
```

To install OpenCV...

```sh
$ pip install opencv-python
```

To install numpy...

```sh
$ pip install numpy
```
